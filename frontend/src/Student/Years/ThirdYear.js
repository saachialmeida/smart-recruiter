                    <h3>The 3rd year can be a bit stressful for many students. Only one year left and then you have to hustle for a job. As a 3rd year student, it’s best to start preparing for your placement from now. Since you will have to tackle both college education and the placement preparations simultaneously, it can seem like a burden. How can you tackle it now? But the pressure will only increase in your 4th year. Time is of the essence, so it’s best to seize the opportunities NOW. Here are some of the things that 3rd-year students should remember when they are preparing for the placement procedure:</h3>

                                        <li>When you go for an interview in a big tech company, the focus of the interviewer will be on your personal projects. This will show them that you take initiatives from your side to work outside your college syllabus. It shows that you are resourceful, creative and would go out of your way for personal growth. So, in your third year, try to at least work on 2 technical projects – be it building a website, an Android app, etc.</li>

                                        <li>Aptitude tests are an underestimated part of the placement procedure. While you might be technically skilled, there is a chance that you may falter while taking the aptitude test. Start practising really well for aptitude tests. Try to maximize your speed in the logic and quantitative aptitude sections. Read a lot of English newspapers to tackle the verbal section. Start solving CAT question papers to master Aptitude tests.</li>

Read up on the placement stories of successful candidates to find out about the questions that they had to face. Try to understand the unique-factor in their replies that got them a job in companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook. Interviews, in general, can be scary. You tend to get nervous. So, conduct mock interviews with friends to ease out the pressure when it’s time to sit before an actual interviewer.</li>

You have to stand out during the GD to actually make a mark in the eyes of your recruiter. But if you are suddenly placed in the group discussion room, you might go all sweaty. So, it’s best to conduct regular GD with your friends or hostel mates. Take up a problem or a case study and start a GD on it. Make it a bit fun too.</li>

                                        <li>While the pressure is quite high during your college years, it will benefit you if you start an internship at a good company. As an intern, you get a much more in-depth knowledge of how your ‘education’ is applied in the real world. It’s a great update for your CV too. Plus, you get to meet new people and create a network. If you do well in the company, you might even be offered a pre-placement offer even before you graduate. </li>
                                        <li>When it comes to internships, it is important to understand the kind of company you should do one with. Should you do an internship at a startup or an enterprise? Well, there are two ways to look at it. By having an internship with a startup, you demonstrate enthusiasm and zeal. However, with large enterprises, you can demonstrate professionalism and meticulous behavior. The right thing to do here would be to balance it out. We all know that you need to have 2-3 internships on your CV. You can keep it as a mixture of internship with a startup, one with a big enterprise company, and one research fellowship at a reputed university if it’s something that interests you.</li>

                                        So, start your preparations and best of luck. Keep your fingers crossed. If you play your cards right, you might get your dream job in one of the top tech firms!
